William Shakespeare wrote a lot of sonnets,
which are some kind of poem that we talked about in English class
but I forgot exactly what they are anyway.

Shakespy’s sonnets are about love, death, and some other stuff.
They are often (always?) written in iambic pentameter,
which is based on the beating of the heart,
which Will’s is not currently doing.

(He’s dead.)
