A/a is the first letter in the Latin (or Roman) alphabet.
It stands for apple, ampersand, and Ambercrombie.

There are “one-story” “a”s, which look kind of like this: ɑ (although that’s not really an a).
Two-story “a”s look like this: a (although that might be a single-story in some fonts).

There are zero “a”s in the word “inegalitarian” if you ignore the three “a”s in it.
