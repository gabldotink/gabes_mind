Albert Einstein was this one really smart guy.
He said “E = mc²”, which isn’t even really that impressive.
I mean, I could’ve said that before him if I’d been alive. So unfair.

His eyes are in storage at the White House, or at least they were at some point.
His brain was being experimented on until his family said “no” and they took it back.
