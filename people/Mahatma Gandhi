Gandhi was a super-callused fragile mystic
hexed by halitosis.

He was an advocate for peace. In the video
game Civilization, his “aggression score”
was so low at around 5 that if you made him
much more peaceful, it would create an integer
overflow to 255, causing Gandhi to become
pretty much the most evil person ever,
destroying whole nations with nuclear weapons.
It was so crazy that they intentionally built
it into later games in the series. Also, it was
an urban legend in the first place.
