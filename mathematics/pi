Pi (π) is an irrational number because it goes on for infinity.
It’s been calculated to 31.4 trillion digits at Google,
because it was funny. I still feel like it’s kind of weird, though?
They presumably could have done more, but it was funny to do the
first three digits, so they didn’t. Humanity really will just do whatever.

All of that is kind of useless (not pointless, just useless) anyway,
because NASA only uses about 15 digits to send rockets into space,
and it only takes around 40 to measure the universe with atomic precision.

I used to be really confused about pi when I was younger,
because I thought “never repeating” meant that it never
repeated a number twice in a row. Either that, or a certain
number pattern just never repeated, with the criteria
for a “pattern” being some arbitrary number of consecutive digits,
which obviously made even less sense, because whatever the number of digits
that couldn’t be repeated was, they would almost certainly repeat
eventually, at some point.

The first digits of pi that I know are 3.141592653589.
I know the first few of those because they were in 𝘗𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘢𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘍𝘦𝘳𝘣.
