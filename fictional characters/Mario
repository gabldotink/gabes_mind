Mario’s last name is Mario. He’s a plumber and he lives in a kingdom full of mushrooms.
He also kart races.

Mario saves Princess Peach from Bowser around every other Tuesday,
or sometimes Thursday if there’s a scheduling conflict.
The reason why Bowser wants Peach is still unknown.

Mario jumps high, runs fast, and eats flowers in order to shoot fire out of his hands.

Mario’s brother is Luigi, whose last name is also Mario.

Mario wears a red shirt, blue overalls, brown shoes, and white gloves.
That is, of course, unless he’s wearing a blue shirt and red overalls,
or a green shirt and red overalls, or if he’s wearing an astronaut outfit for no practical reason.

Mario is Italian and likes pastrami.
