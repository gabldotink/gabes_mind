2020 was pretty bad.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared
an international emergency in January.
Work and school largely moved to the home over the internet.
It killed millions of people and kind of drove everyone crazy.

Politics got dangerously divisive.
Riots and violent protests occurred.
Social media got even worse.
People got less active.

People also learned plenty of new skills
and had many new experiences.
So that was alright.

My productivity took an absolutely massive nosedive.
I didnâ€™t feel like doing much of anything at all.
My missed opportunity to get stuff done during the quarantine
still miserably haunts me to this day.
