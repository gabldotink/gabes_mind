  Gabeâ€™s mind
                                             
This repository contains the entire contents of my mind.
(It might take a while to actually get there.)

Much of my mind is ironic, so take stuff here with a grain of salt.

Also, my mind uses a lot of irregular Unicode characters.
They may not display correctly for you. Be forewarned.
