Comments in source code tells people what something in your code does,
or yourself, because you don’t really know what it does either.

Different languages have different comment formats.
Some use a pound sign, or a hashtag, or whatever.
Some use two slashes. Some evil ones use semicolons.
Some languages support multi-line comments,
which give a longer explanation or note over multiple lines,
and they aren’t usually much fun to write.
HTML and other SGML, as well as Markdown and wikicode and whatever,
uses <!-- whatever these are -->, even if you only use one line.
I think C uses /* this */? But I’m still too dumb to learn C.
