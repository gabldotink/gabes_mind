Random access memory (RAM) is volatile storage for a computing device
which stores the most recent and relevant data for quick retrieval.

Bill Gates once said that 640 kilobytes would always be enough RAM.
Now Mozilla Firefox recommends 512 megabytes of RAM to run the 32-bit version on Windows.
Also, Gates never said that.

Of course, if you donâ€™t have enough, you can always download more.
