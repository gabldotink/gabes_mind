Super Mario Galaxy is Super Mario in the galaxy.

Actually, Mario is in a lot of different galaxies,
none of which should really qualify as a galaxy.
None of the planets are big enough to realistically hold themselves together, either.
Nobody cares though, except the university students who wrote a thesis about it.

10/10 gameplay, 10/10 dialogue, 11/10 graphics (on the Wii, too!), 12/10 OST. No Toadsworth though.

My save file on the Wii had 120 stars as Mario and 104 as Luigi,
but Luigi’s pre-rendered cutscene for the final level wouldn’t load and crashed the game.
I tried again on the Nintendo Switch,
but I still didn’t finish it.
